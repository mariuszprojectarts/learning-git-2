    <p>If all of the kings had their queens on the throne
        <br>We would pop champagne and raise a toast
        <br>To all of the queens who are fighting alone
        <br>Baby, you're not dancing on your own</p>

    <p>Can't live without me, you wanna, but you can't, nah-nah-nah
        <br>Think it's funny, but honey, can't run this show on your own
        <br>I can feel my body shake, there's only so much I can take
        <br>I'll show you how a real queen behaves</p>

    <p>Oh, no damsel in distress, don't need to save me
        <br>Once I start breathing fire, you can't tame me
        <br>And you might think I'm weak without a sword
        <br>But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours</p>
